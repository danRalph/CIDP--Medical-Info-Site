                </h4>
                <p class="about aniview slow" data-av-animation="fadeInUp">
                    Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare neurological disorder in which there is inflammation of nerve roots and peripheral nerves and destruction of the fatty protective covering (myelin sheath) over the nerves. This affects how fast the nerve signals are transmitted and leads to loss of nerve fibers. This causes weakness, paralysis and/or impairment in motor function, especially of the arms and legs (limbs). Sensory disturbance may also be present. The motor and sensory impairments usually affect both sides of the body (symmetrical), and the degree of severity and the course of disease may vary from case to case. Some affected individuals may follow a slow steady pattern of symptoms while others may have symptoms that stabilize and then relapse.

                INTRODUCTION 
                </h4>
                <p class="about aniview slow" data-av-animation="fadeInUp">
                CIDP is sometimes thought of as the chronic form of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), the most common form of Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS), in the United States and Europe. In contrast to GBS, most patients with CIDP cannot identify a preceding viral or infectious illness. GBS is a subacute disorder that progresses over 3-4 weeks, then plateaus and usually improves over months and does not recur. CIDP, by definition has ongoing symptoms for over 8 weeks and usually does not improve unless ongoing treatment is given.

                    SIGNS & SYMPTOMS
                </h4>
                <p class="about aniview slow" data-av-animation="fadeInUp">
                    The chief symptoms of CIDP are slowly progressive (over at least 2 months) symmetric weakness of both muscles around the hip and shoulder as well as of the hands and feet (both proximal and distal muscles). This pattern of weakness, if caused by nerve damage, is highly suggestive of CIDP. Nerve signals become altered causing impairment in motor function and/or abnormal, or loss of, sensation. There are usually some alterations of sensation causing incoordination, numbness, tingling, or prickling sensations. Some patients only have sensory symptoms and signs but have the typical abnormalities of nerve conduction and respond to treatment as in CIDP in which weakness predominates. This is considered the sensory variant of CIDP.

                    Other symptoms of CIDP include fatigue, burning, pain, clumsiness, difficulty swallowing and double vision. The neurologic examination will show weak muscles that may have lost their bulk and definition (atrophy).  Deep tendon reflexes are reduced or absent. Walking will be abnormal and responses to various sensory stimuli will be impaired.

                    CAUSES
                </h4>
                <p class="about aniview slow" data-av-animation="fadeInUp">
                    The exact cause of CIDP is unknown but there are strong indications that CIDP is an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur when the bodys natural defenses (antibodies and lymphocytes) against invading organisms suddenly begin to attack perfectly healthy tissue. The cause of autoimmune disorders is unknown.

                    DIAGNOSIS
                </h4>
                <p class="about aniview slow" data-av-animation="fadeInUp">
                    CIDP can be difficult to diagnose. The symptoms must be present for at least two months and symmetric proximal and distal weakness with reduced or absent tendon reflexes are highly suggestive of CIDP. Tests that can be of diagnostic help include nerve conduction testing and electromyography looking for very slow nerve conduction velocities, lumbar puncture looking for elevated spinal fluid protein without many inflammatory cells and MRI imaging of the nerve roots looking for enlargement and signs of inflammation.

                    STANDARD TREATMENTS
                </h4>
                <p class="about aniview slow" data-av-animation="fadeInUp">
                    In 2018, Hizentra, developed by CSL Behring, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for CIDP.

                    Glucocorticoid drugs such as prednisone have proven effective in treating individuals with CIDP. In many cases, individuals with CIDP may respond to corticosteroid treatment alone. However, individuals requiring high doses of corticosteroid drugs may experience side effects that deter long-term therapy. Corticosteroids may also be used in conjunction with other drugs such as those that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressive drugs). Azathioprine, mycophenolate, methotrexate, cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide are immunosuppressive drugs that have been used to treat CIDP but have not been proven to be effective in large patient trials.

                    Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been proven to be effective and is often used as a treatment for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. IVIG can enhance the immune system. Very high doses are usually used for initial treatment of CIDP and most patients require continued intermittent treatments. There is a clinical trial of a subcutaneous delivery of immunoglobulin that may be used instead of IVIG.

                    Plasma exchange (PE) has also been shown to be of benefit in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. This procedure is a method for removing unwanted substances (toxins, metabolic substances and plasma parts) from the blood. Blood is removed from an affected individual and blood cells are separated from plasma. The plasma is then replaced with other human plasma and the patients blood cells are transfused back into the affected individual, thus removing only the plasma and its constituents. Similar to IVIG, PE is effective only for a few weeks and may require chronic intermittent treatments.

                    EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS
                </h4>
                <p class="about aniview slow" data-av-animation="fadeInUp">
                    There is a great deal of interest in using monoclonal antibodies to treat CIDP. Clinical trials are being developed to use rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against immune forming lymphocytes (B cells). Another monoclonal antibody under consideration is alemtuzumab which acts on both B cells and T cells, providing a broader attack on the immune system. Some of the agents that have been found to be effective in multiple sclerosis are now being considered for CIDP. A clinical trial treating patients with fingolimod, a drug that affects the ability of lymphocytes to contribute to immune function, is now underway.
